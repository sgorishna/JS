	<h2>Researchers find sweet source for aviation biofuel</h2>

	<p>
		The source crops could be grown on marginal land, avoiding displacing
		food production, the team observed. They added the development of
		renewable liquid fuels was critical to reduce global reliance on
		petroleum and help mitigate climate change. The findings <a href="">appear
			in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</a>

	<h3>Biofuel sweetspot</h3>

	"We've identified a new route of chemistry with its source from sugars
	in sugarcane plus some of the so-called waste material called bagasse,"
	said co-author Alexis Bell from the
	<b><i>University of California, Berkeley, US.</i></b>

	<p>
		<i>"We show in this paper how we can put these components together
			to make jet diesel and lubricants."</i>
	<p>The development of a reliable biofuel that can be scaled up to a
		level that be used by the world's commercial airlines has proved
		somewhat elusive.</p>

	<p>Prof Bell explained that there were a number of understandably
		strict requirements when it came to aviation fuel.</p>

	<p>"The first one is that there must be no oxygen content, the
		reason being that any oxygen you put in decreases the energy density
		and as space on an aircraft is at a premium, and you'd like to pack in
		as much energy in the form of burnable fuel as possible," he told BBC
		News.</p>
